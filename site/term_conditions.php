                TOGETHER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THE NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES CONSTITUTE YOUR
                SERVICE AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”) WITH ACCESS PAYS. THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY
                BINDING TERMS FOR YOUR USE OF OUR WEB SITE, ANY ASSOCIATION YOU MAY ESTABLISH ON THE SITE,
                AND YOUR PURCHASE OR USE OF ANY PAYMENT REMINDERS OR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED ON
                THE SITE. BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE WEB SITE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE
                THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO THE AGREEMENT AND TO ABIDE BY ALL OF THE
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE, BECOME A
                ACCESS PAYS MEMBER OR CLIENT, OR ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT UNLESS YOU ARE THE AGE OF
                MAJORITY IN YOUR JURISDICTION OF RESIDENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS
                AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS AND/OR USE THE WEB SITE, SIGN UP FOR MEMBERSHIP, OR
                PURCHASE PRODUCTS OR MAKE PAYMENT AND USE THE SERVICES THROUGH THIS WEB SITE.
                Client (you) acknowledges that in conjunction with our day to day sales, service and business purposes,
                Access Pays is not technology provider. It is not a bank, credit union, payment processor or other
                financial institution. Payment processing services for users on Access Pays are provided by third-party
                payment processors.
                Client (you) hereby authorizes Access Pays to hold, receive and disburse funds on its behalf and to
                transfer the funds to the Bank Account to effectuate payment to Access Pays of any Fees, and for
                Merchant to receive any Net Sales Proceeds. The Client (you) authorization permits Access Pays to
                generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each Payment transaction that the
                Client (you) authorizes. Client authorization under this Section will remain in full force and effect
                during the Term.
                Once the clients (you) Account information is verified, Access Pays will automatically deposit the Net
                Sales Proceeds collected to Retailer&#39;s Bank Account (the bank account you associated business with
                needed to clear your out standing debt) via direct deposit. This deposit will normally appear in the
                retailer’s Bank Account within 3-7 business days but no longer than 30 business days after payment
                settlement is initiated.
                If (you) the client has not provided goods or services consistent with this Agreement with respect to a
                particular transaction(s), Access Pays will have the right to refuse to pay any Net Sales Proceeds to
                Retailer’s and/or to pay a refund to any End Client or Customer or Retailer. There may be times when
                an End Client may not be the authorized user of a credit card or the End Client may otherwise contest
                the transaction. In these instances, the amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back (a
                “Chargeback”) if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by our processor, or an
                End customer or its financial institution, (c) was not authorized or we have any reason to believe that
                the transaction was not authorized, or (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these
                terms. You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to the liability associated with such
                Chargebacks.
                Access Pays reserves the right to adjust the Net Sales Proceeds due for any period to compensate
                Access Pays for any Chargebacks, calculation errors, Merchant employee fraudulent use, and any
                refunds paid to Customers/Retailer’s, whether or not related to the period on which such adjustment is
                made, or to offset against such Net Sales Proceeds any other claim Access Pays may have arising
                hereunder.
                Access Pays may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that the client (you) submits to
                Access Pays if Access Pays reasonably believes that the transaction is in violation of any Access Pays
                
                agreement, or exposes Merchant, End Customers/Retailer’s, or Access Pays to harm. Harm includes
                without limitation fraud, a violation of individual or proprietary rights and other criminal acts.
                The card processing networks require that Client (you) and Access Pays comply with all Applicable Law.
                Access Pays may modify this Agreement to comply with, and as a result of, amendments to Applicable
                Law.
                No Warranty. THE PAYMENT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF
                WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. ACCESS PAYS, OUR PARENT AND AFFILIATES,
                OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURES, EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY
                DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Access Pays does not have any control over the products or
                services that are paid for with the Access Pays Services and Access Pays cannot ensure that a buyer or
                a Seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. Access
                Pays does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Access Pays
                Services, and operation of our site may be temporarily suspended for maintenance or upgrade or
                interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. Access Pays will make reasonable efforts to
                ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, credit cards, and check
                issuances are processed in a timely manner but Access Pays makes no representations or warranties
                regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the Access Pays Services are
                dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or mail
                service. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, so the foregoing
                disclaimers may not apply to you. This paragraph gives you specific legal rights and you may also have
                other legal rights that vary from country/region to country/region.

                 <strong>Disputing Fees. </strong>  
                    (You) the client is responsible for promptly and carefully reviewing amounts invoiced
                    and its payment of Fees. In the event that Client (you) wishes to dispute any Fees charged to or paid by
                    Merchant under this Agreement, Merchant must provide Access Pays with written notice of the dispute
                    (the “Disputed Fees Notice”) by sending an email to support@AccessPaysca within thirty (30) days of
                    the date that the invoice at issue was made available by Access Pays (the “Dispute Timeframe”). Such
                    Disputed Fees Notice should set out the nature of the dispute along with all available supporting

                    outside of the Dispute Timeframe, Access Pays shall have no obligation to investigate or effect any
                    adjustments to the disputed Fees, and any voluntary efforts by Access Pays to assist Client (you) in
                    investigating such disputed Fees shall not create any obligation to continue such investigation or any
                    future investigation.

                    laws and regulations to protect the security of the Services, Customer Data and Merchant Data in order
                    to prevent a data breach. In the event that Merchant becomes aware of or suspects any unauthorized
                    access to or use of the Services, an Account, Client (you) or Customer Data or Merchant Data,
                    Merchant shall immediately notify Access Pays along with a detailed description of the actual or
                    suspected data breach. Merchant and Access Pays agree to fully cooperate with each other in the event
                    of a data breach.
