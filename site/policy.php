                    The security of your Personal Information is important to us. Personal Information collected by
                    the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. Our security
                    procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your
                    Personal Information to you. In certain telephone and in person transactions we may ask for
                    your full Social Security number, account number or other information to verify your identity
                    before conducting the transactions you have requested. Note that Access Pays will never
                    initiate a request via email for your sensitive information (e.g., Social Security number,
                    personal ID, password, PIN or account number). If you receive an email asking for your
                    sensitive information, you should be suspicious of the request and promptly contact us to
                    report the suspicious activity. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to

                    whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are
                    located, you should not submit your Personal Information to Access Pays.
